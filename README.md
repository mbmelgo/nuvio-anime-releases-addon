> A lightweight, season-aware anime release catalog for Nuvio and Stremio-compatible clients.

**Anime Releases for Nuvio** discovers anime releases from **AniList** and exposes **MAL identities when available**, with an `anilist:<id>` fallback when MAL is unavailable. Detailed anime metadata and provider mapping are intentionally delegated to the metadata addon configured in the client.

## ✨ Features

### 📺 Seasonal catalogs

The addon dynamically exposes:

- **Upcoming Season**
- **Current Season**
- **Previous Season**

The season windows are calculated from the current date rather than hard-coded to a particular year.

### ⏱️ Rolling release catalogs

Two rolling catalogs complement the seasonal views:

- **Upcoming — 5 days** — unique anime with an upcoming airing within the next five days.
- **Previous — 7 days** — unique anime with an airing within the previous seven days.

Rolling catalogs use AniList airing schedules, deduplicate by anime, and paginate the resulting unique catalog for Nuvio.

### 🔑 MAL-first catalog identity

Catalog items normally use:

```text
mal:<id>
```

When AniList has no valid MAL id, the item falls back to:

```text
anilist:<id>
```

The catalog keeps the AniList source id in the item's extra metadata so downstream systems can correlate the entry when needed.

### 📄 Nuvio pagination

- AniList seasonal pages use **50 items**, matching the Nuvio catalog page size.
- Rolling catalogs paginate **after** schedule records are filtered and deduplicated.
- Nuvio search parameters are supported by the catalog endpoints.

### 🎞️ Supported anime formats

Seasonal catalog discovery includes:

- TV
- TV Short
- ONA
- OVA
- Special
- Movie

Adult entries are excluded.

## 🖼️ What it looks like

The repository includes representative Nuvio-style screenshots for the addon views.

#### Previous — 7 days

The rolling views are intentionally shown separately so the upcoming and previous release sets are clear.

### Metadata detail flow

The production flow is:

```text
AniList release discovery
        ↓
mal:<id> (or anilist:<id> fallback)
        ↓
Nuvio catalog
        ↓

```

## 🧩 Architecture

```text
┌──────────────────────┐
│       AniList        │
│ release / airing data│
└──────────┬───────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌──────────────────────┐
│ Anime Releases       │
│      for Nuvio       │
│ MAL-first identities │
└──────────┬───────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌──────────────────────┐

└──────────┬───────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌──────────────────────┐
│ Configured metadata  │
│       addon          │
└──────────────────────┘
```

This addon is intentionally **catalog-focused**. It does not duplicate detailed metadata, provider mapping, or playback resolution.

## 📦 Installation

### Production manifest

The landing page provides the manifest, current catalog endpoints, release information, and representative screenshots.

## 📋 Production catalogs

| Catalog | Endpoint |

## 🚦 Release pipeline

Production releases follow:

```text
Feature / change
  ↓
PR CI
  ↓
Merge to main
  ↓
Main CI + patch versioning
  ↓
Explicit release authorization
  ↓
Release/version integrity validation
  ↓
Controlled Vercel deployment
  ↓
Production validation: manifest + all 5 catalogs + metadata boundary
  ↓
Annotated Git tag + GitHub Release
  ↓
Release-state update
```

Release metadata is validated across `api/version.js`, `package.json`, `README.md`, and `ops/release-state.json`. Production validation checks all five supported catalogs for valid, unique Nuvio series identities and catalog-specific rolling metadata.

## 📄 Scope

This addon is responsible for:

- seasonal anime release discovery
- rolling upcoming/recent airing discovery
- MAL-first catalog identities with AniList fallback
- Nuvio-compatible catalog pagination
- catalog search
- dynamic seasonal organization

It is **not** a replacement for a detailed anime metadata/provider addon.
